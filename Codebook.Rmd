## Codebook For run_analysis.R

Data for this project was collected from the following study: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Experimental Design and Background
From the website: "The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data."

### Raw Data
The accelerometer inertial signal data are stored in files by training and test sets, then by x and y axis. The original feature names (columns) are contained in the file "features.txt" in this repository. The six activity labels are available in the file "activity_labels.txt", also in this repository.

### Processed Data
Downloaded data, read from all test and training files as well as the activity and feature files, combined test and training data, reduced data set to only the desired columns (subject, activity, columns containing mean or stand deviation), edited column names for readability, arranged/grouped/summarized the data, wrote out the data to a .csv file to be able to review in Excel.

The final variable (column) names used in this project are saved in the repository file "final_column_names.txt".
